# Overview

Summer Framework is a lightweight dependency injection and web framework inspired by Spring Framework, providing essential functionality for Java application development.

# What is Summer Framework?

Summer Framework is a modular Java framework designed to simplify application development through dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, database access, and web MVC capabilities. It follows a similar architectural pattern to Spring Framework but with a more focused feature set and lightweight design.

The framework is built on Java 21 and provides a complete solution for building web applications, from IoC container to web request handling and database access.

# Framework Architecture

The Summer Framework is organized into five core modules that build upon each other to provide a comprehensive development stack:

- summer-context: Core IoC container that support annotation-based injection;
- summer-aop: AOP support for annotation-based subclassing proxy;
- summer-jdbc: Provides JdbcTemplate and declarative transaction management;
- summer-web: Support web application with Servlet 6.0;
- summer-boot: Run Summer application simple and quick like Spring Boot.
